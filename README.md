# Course Case: Apprentice Chef <br><br><br>
## Description:<br>
Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home.
Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide
selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes
at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's awardwinning
disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and
easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile
app.<br><br>
## Case Challenge Part I (Individual Assignment 1)<br>
After three years serving customers across the San Francisco Bay Area, the executives at
Apprentice Chef have come to realize that over 90% of their revenue comes from customers
that have been ordering meal sets for 12 months or less. Given this information, they would like
to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of
orders. Thus, they have hired you on a full-time contract to analyze their data, develop your top
insights, and build a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each
customerâ€™s life cycle.<br><br>
## Case Challenge Part II (Individual Assignment 2)<br>
In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There,
a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California
vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef
also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product
offering of hard to find local wines.<br>
Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset you received,
and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. They have tasked
you with analyzing their data, developing your top insights, and building a machine learning
model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.<br>
